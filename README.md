### Hi! My name is Monika

##
My first experience with programming was during my PhD when I was building statistical models using the R language for statistical computing to analyse data. I also used graphical packages of R and CorelDraw to present the complex data in audience-friendly ways.

Then I worked in fast-paced environment of large corporations. Ever since then effective multitasking and cross-cultural communication in English and occasionally in German became my daily routine.

However, due to my passion for learning and constant curiosity my interest in programming began to grow... Therefore, in 2019 I have started learning the web development through a several-month long bootcamp (Kodilla Web Developer), the online and face-to-face courses (Udemy, Stacja IT), and on my own.

Currently, I am working on a new personal project to practice React and React Redux.
